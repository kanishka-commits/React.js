### What's `actionCodeSettings` object is and why it's important in Firebase email link authentication (also called Email OTP / Email Magic Link login):\
&nbsp; &nbsp; In Firebase, when you use email link sign-in (also known as passwordless login), you send a sign-in link to the user’s email. \ This link must:
redirect the user back to your app, and
contain a secure token to complete authentication.\
To configure how this link behaves, you use the actionCodeSettings object.

### await sendSignInLinkToEmail(auth, email, actionCodeSettings);
This is a Firebase function that sends a magic link (sign-in link) to the provided email.\
It uses auth (your Firebase auth instance) and actionCodeSettings (to define the return URL and handling logic).\
It’s awaited, meaning the code will pause here until the link is successfully sent.
